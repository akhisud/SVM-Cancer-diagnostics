# SVM-Cancer-diagnostics
Improving cancer diagnostics using machine learning (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

This work was submitted as an undergraduate team project in the course 'Machine Learning' during Fall 2016. Implementation is done in R, using RWeka libraries. 

## Usage:
1) Obtain the dataset from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68086
2) Place the dataset in the program directory 
3) Run partition_data.R to partition the dataset
4) Run SVM.R on partitioned data
